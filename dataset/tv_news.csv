SBF believes people wired $8 billion to Alameda.The banks’ compliance procedures are sure to attract greater scrutiny from prosecutors and regulators. In fact, Sam Bankman-Fried indicated that transfers meant for the crypto exchange may have been directed toward its sister company Alameda. FTX's new CEO John J. Ray III tasked with overseeing bankruptcy claimed he’s never seen “such a complete failure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy financial information as occurred here.”Meanwhile, a Silvergate representative stated the bank doesn’t comment on customers or their activities as per their policy. Alma Angotti, a former enforcer at the SEC and Treasury Dept., said the arrangement puts banks at risk if they knew about the setup.""It’s very bad practice and risk management in any book to mingle your customer funds with counterparty funds and other funds. This is a complicated set of facts and it’s hard to say at this point what was violated. It’s bad risk management and it’s sloppy at the very least.""Also Read: FTX-Tether Connection: Involvement Of Banks Raises QuestionsFTX and approximately 101 additional affiliated companies are resuming ordinary course payments of salary to employees worldwide and ordinary course payments to certain non-U.S. contractors and service providers. However, it will not make payments to Sam Bankman-Fried, Gary Wang, Nishad Singh, Caroline Ellison, or persons with whom they have any family relationship.CEO John Ray said:""With the Court's approval of our First Day motions and the work being done on global cash management, I am pleased that the FTX group is resuming ordinary course cash payments of salaries and benefits to our remaining employees around the world.""Also Read: BlockFi Files For Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Protection"

Bitcoin’s hashrate calculation These data are not precise readings, but estimates calculated based on several factors, including difficulty and block-time.

In the last 24 hours and last week, the price recorded a 2% and 4% profit, respectively. Other cryptocurrencies in the crypto top 10 are following, but Binance Coin (BNB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) are leading the bounce. BTC’s price moving sideways on the daily chart. Source: Investment firm Cumberland posted a market update highlighting the uncertainty in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The nascent asset class is trading in a range after experiencing massive sell pressure amid the collapse of FTX. In this uncertain and low liquidity environment, with FTX and its market maker Alameda Research out of the picture, the Bitcoin price will likely trade sideways. During the holiday season, the crypto market will see another decline in liquidity, leading to volatility and crab-like price action. However, Cumberland believes there are catalysts to see a move into fresh lows. The FTX collapse triggered a contagion effect across the industry. Many companies and projects relied on the crypto exchange and its venture arm. Thus, these companies are vulnerable and might be unable to continue operations. The market is already seeing this effect with BlockFi’s chapter 11 bankruptcy filing. Many wonder how many companies will take a similar measure in the coming weeks. If many more crypto projects halt operations, the crypto market might see fresh lows before 2022 ends. Cumberland said the following on the state of “crypto lending 1.0”:On the other hand, the bullish case for the Bitcoin price is seeing some momentum on the back of adoption. Ironically, the collapse of FTX is driving many users to take custody of their assets and become less dependent on third-party services. In addition, Cumberland sees an enduring bullish trend for stablecoin-based use cases, non-fungible token (NFT) technology, and Ethereum/Polygon as the foundation for Web2 businesses. The firm added:Cumberland believes regulations might drive momentum to either side. If the regulatory landscape for 2023 seems favorable, Bitcoin and others might enjoy sustainable relief into previously lost territory. In the options market, as NewsBTC reported, players are betting on buy (call) contracts and sell (put) contracts targeting $30,000 and $10,000, respectively.

From high-interest-paying wallets to safe crypto exchanges, the platforms provide a convincing portfolio-managing experience and much more. Furthermore, the fully automated arbitrage trading system is one of their key services providing a steady stream of passive returns.From a technical perspective, the ArbiSmart Token price shows the formation of a falling wedge pattern in the daily time frame chart. In theory, this bullish continuation pattern reflects a gradual growth in buying momentum and offers a long entry opportunity upon breaking its resistance trendline.Source- Since last month, the multiple retests to the pattern’s downsloping trendlines indicate the traders strictly follow this pattern and may respond to its potential target shortly. On 24th November, the RBIS price gave an upside breakout from the wedge pattern’s trendline, indicating the buyers were wrestling for trend control. By the press time, the ArbiSmart Token price trades at the $0.265 mark, with an intraday loss of 0.65%. Furthermore, the altcoin is on the retest phase for the past four days, checking its sustainability above the breached trendline.If the price sustains at a higher price, the technical setup may push the token price to $1, registering a $275% growth. Moreover, a potential U-shaped recovery will drive the prices above $2.Conversely, a daily candle closing below the support trendline may stall the bullish thesis.Relative Strength Index: despite a lower low formation in price action, the daily-RSI rising indicates the buying activity is getting aggressive at lower levels. Moreover, this bullish divergence bolsters an upside breakout from this pattern’s resistance trendline.EMAs: The falling EMAs(20, 50, 100, and 200) may offer dynamic resistance and reflect sustained selling in the market. However, if breakout from these EMA slopes could flip them into potential support.The ArbiSmart (RBIS) platform launches a new Currency Purchase Program to make crypto purchases more profitable for investors. Under this program, the user gets 10% to 50% discounts on all the cryptocurrencies and Fiat bought through the platform. For instance, a buyer who qualified for a 30% discount on a $25000 Bitcoin purchase would pay only $17500 and can still withdraw the full $25000 value of Bitcoin by the end of the mandatory vesting period.Furthermore, the available discounts are determined by certain factors, such as which currency is purchased, the purchase amount, the vesting period selected, and whether or not the RBIS token is also locked for the selected period. The platform supports about 30 different FIAT and cryptocurrencies, from market leaders- Bitcoin and Ethereum to meme coins such as Dogecoin and Shiba Inu.Moreover, ArbiSmart also features a new referral program in which the referrer earns up to 10% of the friend’s interest on savings. This referral commission is earned daily and could last up to 5 years.Upcoming feature: (Expected launch-Between December 2022 and the end of Q1 2023)ArbiSmart will launch an array of new interlinked services, which will require RBIS ownership and provide preferential terms for payments made using the native token. These services include a wallet app, a DeFi protocol, a fresh spin on yield farming, exciting gamification features, an ArbiSmart NFT collection, an NFT marketplace, a play-to-earn(P2E) metaverse having RBIS as the in-game currency, and a crypto exchange.Completing the bullish pattern mentioned above, the ArbiSmart Token(RBIS) may witness a direction rally and pass the $2.87 mark by march 2023 end.The RBIS price may experience some fluctuations given the recession fears on the global market, but it will likely surpass the $6.9 psychological level by the end of 2025.Considering the overall crypto market obtains an established bull trend, the ArbiSmart Token could rise above the $28.5 mark."

Recently, the bulk of DApps have been created on the Ethereum platform, which distinguishes it from other blockchains.The sanctity of the outcome is what makes the EVM, in particular, and the Ethereum blockchain, in general, well-suited to the sustainable expansion of the DApp and smart contract Ethereum ecosystem.When creating on Ethereum, developers and business owners must take some drawbacks into account. The most significant of these is the expensive gas or transaction fees connected with using a smart contract on the Ethereum network.Like other cryptocurrencies, investment in Ethereum carries some risk. Due to their high volatility, cryptocurrencies can see both substantial profits and losses. Ether's price has fluctuated a lot in the past, which could be a big disadvantage for certain investors, especially novices.EVMs is playing a key role in shaping the future of medical education. The American Medical Association (AMA) recently invited EVMS to join a nationwide consortium aimed at bridging the gap between how medical students are educated and how health care is delivered.Nowadays, developers prioritize cross-chain compatibility, and a number of EVM-compatible blockchains have emerged, the majority of which provide lower gas prices and faster transaction times than the Ethereum protocol.Also Read: Bitfront News: Crypto Exchange Bitfront Announces Its Shutdown; Here’s Why"

It filed for bankruptcy in the United States on 11 November 2022.Bitfront has already suspended credit card services and new sign-ups from November 28.

Also, the additional forced withdrawal of interests and deposits of LN/LN products will be done by December 13. The ability to make withdrawals will be put to a stop on 31 March 2023.Bitfront expressed gratitude and issued an apology to customers who used their services and had a voice in developing the platform."

However, not everyone calmed down and even VC-tier investors are seeking details.According to Mira Christanto, a VC investor and manager of a $7 billion TradFi equities fund, a large transaction cannot be a part of an audit since the methodology used by most auditors does not include signing and making any kind of transaction on the network.Previously, Binance or its representatives did not provide details on the company that conducted the audit and did not comment further. Lack of transparency caused even more disruption to the industry.Christanto added that the auditor will be physically present and would ask exchange representatives to sign a message using the private keys of addresses holding the funds. The requirement to move funds is unusual, and no such practice exists among auditors. But users quickly made a correction.Auditors indeed did not ask Binance to move $2 billion for whatever reason. However, some blockchain-based operations took place on the market, and such a large transaction volume is the result of a UTXO transaction scheme that sends out the whole balance to another address and then returns it after deducting the sent sum.Technically, one of Binance's wallets could have transferred or signed some kind of operation, which is technically a transaction for a blockchain. Because of UTXO, the whole balance of the wallet was transferred and then returned to the exchange's address."

The Mortons’ particular concerns were regarding Nexo’s structure, its regulatory status with the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), and the extent to which the sum of all Nexo tokens was owned by Nexo employees. These concerns of the investor family, which has now been forced to file a lawsuit, had already been expressed to the Nexo company, back in December 2020. But an unsatisfactory response from Nexo executives meant that in March 2021, the Mortons decided and tried to sell their Nexo tokens in order to withdraw all of their initial investment of £126 million. However, their withdrawal attempt was bitterly blocked, first by imposing a withdrawal limit at $150,000 per day. Then on 23 March 2021, Nexo completely blocked the entrepreneurs from withdrawing their assets, freezing their funds and their ability to attempt to withdraw.Subsequently, with unclear explanations as to why the assets were frozen, Nexo executives offered the Morten family to sell their tokens to Nexo at a 60% discount to their next price. The Mortens were almost forced to accept, but some time later, certainly after hearing multiple legal opinions, they decided to intimate a lawsuit in the High Court in London. Nexo and its products are challenged as not solvent After the news of the lawsuit in London, there is no end of trouble for Nexo, which this time is under the radar for its crypto products. Indeed, although the co-founders have already assured that the platform is solvent, many crypto experts have refuted these claims stating that Nexo and its products cannot be solvent, especially after the FTX collapse.Cryptocurrency analyst Dylan Leclair has questioned this, namely Nexo’s rate of return compared to the average decentralized finance (DeFi) market. LeClair explained: The fact that companies such as Celsius, BlockFi, Voyager, and Vauld, which serve the same function as Nexo, have been bitterly affected since the FTX collapse, whereas Nexo does not seem to be taking the hit, puts the analyst in a quandary. LeClair argues that through user-backed loans, Nexo earns interest at a rate higher than the yield offered. The problem here is that in a system without a lender of last resort, the commercial banking model on crypto rails can explode, quickly. Moreover, the fact that Nexo, controls over 82% of the total supply of its tokens, does not bode well for the analyst. "

The loss in value that led TerraClassicUSD to touch $0.02 after the events of May did not stop those who had invested in the digital currency. Currently, UST has a value of $0.02, but according to the community that still supports it, it could return with a resounding blowback to peg at $1.Six months after USTC’s “slide” that so hurt the market as well, early investors are hoping to see the algorithmic stablecoin still at $1. The currency broke free from its link to the dollar on 9 May but that does not detract from the fact that recovery is possible. Terra Luna: community hopes for a revival of the crypto project The hypothesis has been debated at length on social media, especially on Twitter, which is the social media of choice for the planet community. Some believe that Terra Money UST (USTC after bankruptcy), backed by those who have always invested in it and maybe even lost money, can aspire to the price range of one US dollar. “Let’s repeg USTC” is the slogan that is in vogue, a kind of “Make America great Again” that is so dear to the US that points to a much-desired repegging of USTC.

Indeed, they have been amplified to the current panic situation generated by young Sam Bankman Fried and his partner in crime Caroline Ellison.As a result, they went to meet their fate, recently declaring bankruptcy.Apparently, Genesis appears to be next, although the company continues to deny it. Were FTX and Celsius financially connected? Recently, an investigation carried out by Dirty Bubble Media, behind the leadership of Mike Burgersburg, unveiled links between FTX and Celsius. These very ties may be among the causes of Celsius’ bankruptcy. According to the investigation, the Celsius company used the FTX trading platform to buy its token (CEL) in 2021. The purchases, it seems, were around 40 million CEL. Moreover, the same coincided with a $750 million fundraising round. In fact, after the freeze on withdrawals, the Celsius company, through the FTX exchange, was able to liquidate millions of dollars in customer assets.Not only that, it also appears that FTX, the company created by Sam Bankman Fried, was a creditor of Celsius through a $104 million loan. Here is what happened to crypto platform Celsius before it declared bankruptcy Inevitably, Celsius’ bankruptcy filing brought to light the exchange platform’s serious difficulties following the collapse of FTX. Apparently, further complicating Celsius’ situation are the testimonies of its equity investors that priority should be given to creditors when dividing up the platform’s remaining assets. Celsius has a deficit of $1.2 billion, consisting largely of user deposits. Who, it is assumed, will never be repaid their investment. However, the puzzling figure revolves around the value of the assets. In fact, the value of the assets in crypto appears to be $1.75 billion, even though the entire market cap of the CEL token is around only $300 million. To reassure investors about the situation, the former CEO of Celsius, Alex Mashinsky, had said that the company would be able to sell mined Bitcoin so that it would be able to repay at least part of its loans and provide future revenue for the company. However, raising even more suspicions about the shady activities of Alex Mashinsky and his company Celsius was the withdrawal of $10 million, made days before the bankruptcy filing.The fact that it was Mashinsky himself who made this withdrawal led most to believe that the hen CEO already knew about the freezing of client funds and the bankruptcy filing, which, in fact, took place shortly thereafter. In this regard, it was Mashinksy’s lawyer who spoke out, stating:  Celsius’s other mistake: insufficient controls in handling client funds In this bankruptcy situation, all the loose ends are emerging for Celsius. In fact, recently, through more in-depth audits, the independent examiner of the Celsius case had declared that the platform had insufficient accounting and operational controls. According to sources, as of 11 June, Celsius’ digital assets in its customers’ Custody Wallet account officially became underfunded. Specifically, on 19 November, in an interim report, examiner Shoba Pillay made a number of strong observations as part of her court-mandated investigation into the bankrupt lending platform.One of the main revelations in Pillay’s report concerns Celsius’ Custody program, about which it states: Launched on 15 April, Celsius’ Custody program allowed users to transfer, exchange and use coins as collateral for a loan. It was introduced following an order from New Jersey security authorities, which required the company to create a tool that differed from the Earn product, which is characterized by receiving rewards.According to Pillay, this mixing of wallets led to a situation where it is unclear what assets belonged to the customer at the time of the bankruptcy filing, the report states: In addition, the interim report also shed light on what forced the lending platform to stop withdrawals on 12 June."

']}]}",The crypto news everyone expected: BlockFi is in bankruptcy,,The Cryptonomist,"The news had been circulating in the crypto industry for days: BlockFi is insolvent and had to file for Chapter 11. On 10 November, in the midst of FTX’s collapse, they had declared that withdrawals were still active, but as early as the next day they announced their indefinite suspension. On 14 November they declared that they had sufficient liquidity to try to keep going, but as early as 23 November they withdrew this statement. Yesterday the official announcement of the Chapter 11 application Crypto news: BlockFi files for Chapter 11 The so-called Chapter 11 is literally the 11th chapter of the US bankruptcy law. It is actually the main provision of that law. Its specific feature is to allow companies that use it to kick off a restructuring process despite filing for bankruptcy. In other words, filing for Chapter 11 means that the company is insolvent and de facto declares bankruptcy because it no longer has sufficient resources to repay all of its debts as they fall due, but not with the primary objective of being liquidated and closed as soon as possible. This does not a priori rule out the possibility that the company may end up being liquidated, but if nothing else it leaves the doors open to a possible restructuring, should it be possible. It is worth noting that unfulfilled customer withdrawals are to be considered debts for all intents and purposes, so the fact that the company has had to suspend them indefinitely is sufficient to say that it is insolvent and therefore in bankruptcy. In light of this it is possible to say that perhaps its management team was aware as early as 11 November that there was a risk of having to file for insolvency. Despite this they publicly stated on the 14th that they had sufficient liquidity to even try to move forward. This attitude suggests it is possible that they lied, making the restructuring hypothesis more theoretical than plausible at this point. Then again, so far all crypto companies that have filed for Chapter 11 have then ended up in liquidation. The alternative to Chapter 11 is Chapter 7, which is to permanently cease operations and place all assets in the hands of a trustee who will proceed with the liquidation, distributing the proceeds to creditors. As a matter of fact, BlockFi’s activities to date have already ceased, although the use of Chapter 11 in theory could also allow them to recover, provided the funds are found to cover the shortfalls. This is because Chapter 11 is a reorganization procedure, not a liquidation procedure, with the purpose of restoring the company to health. The reorganization and recovery process can take months or years, and can result in exit from Chapter 11 and resumption of operations if successful, or Chapter 7 in the event of bankruptcy. BlockFi’s bankruptcy filing in this week’s crypto news In the official statement released yesterday, the company states that they have initiated the restructuring process to stabilize the business and maximize value for all customers and stakeholders. It therefore does not state that they intend to reopen operations anytime soon, partly because the outcome of the restructuring procedure at this time is uncertain. They also reveal that eight subsidiaries are involved in this restructuring, and that the Chapter 11 petition has been made to the US Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey. In the statement, they seem to blame their insolvency on FTX, in other words, on having uncollectible debts with them. They add: BlockFi‘s financial advisor, Mark Renzi of the Berkeley Research Group, says that at the time of FTX’s collapse, BlockFi’s management team and board of directors took action to protect clients. It is possible that he is referring to the 11 November decision to suspend withdrawals, but the previous day, when the FTX collapse had already begun, the company instead publicly stated that it had not blocked them. The statement also reveals that BlockFi is filing a series of motions with the bankruptcy court to get permission to continue its operations. However, these are not aimed at resuming services provided to customers, but primarily to pay salaries to employees so as to “ensure the company retains trained internal resources for business.”They also state that they have initiated an internal plan to significantly reduce expenses, including labor costs.In fact, they specify in the statement that customer services continue to be suspended, despite the fact that the company has $256.9 million in cash. However, this money will be used to provide sufficient liquidity to support the operations of the restructuring process.So it is presumable that customer services can only resume if the restructuring plan is successful or when it is clear that it is moving in that direction. BlockFi’s creditors While BlockFi’s main debtor is probably the bankrupt FTX, some surprises appear in the list of creditors. Debtors are those who are supposed to pay money back to the company, while creditors are those to whom the company itself must repay the funding it has granted. All users of its platform who still had funds on deposit at the time withdrawals were suspended are creditors. But creditors also include other companies that were not necessarily users of the platform, and were simply waiting to be paid for other reasons. One major customer who had funds on deposit has a claim against the company of as much as $48 million, but it is not the largest creditor. The largest creditor is Ankura Trust Company, which has an impressive claim of nearly $730 million. The second largest creditor is West Realm Shires, with $275 million, which appears to be connected with FTX US. FTX US is the company that operated the US exchange FTX.US, while FTX is the Bahamian company that operated the international exchange FTX.com. So while FTX is probably the largest debtor, FTX US is the second largest creditor. Interestingly, in fourth place among BlockFi’s creditors is the New York Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC), with $30 million. The stated nature of this claim is “settlement.” All other major creditors are customers. Corporate restructuring Although the company’s intent at present is to restructure its operations probably to try to get back into operation sooner or later, at this time such a scenario actually seems unlikely. In fact, since the company is no longer producing income, and therefore profits, it would take large financiers to cover the budget holes and get it back on its feet. Meanwhile, they are laying off many employees, keeping only key ones. However, staff reduction had already begun in June, due to the sharp drop in profits, so the situation had been in the balance for some time. It actually turns out to be really difficult to imagine how to restructure a company under such conditions to the point where it can really get going again. Probably the only real solution would be a purchase by another company interested in taking over its operations or market share. In this regard, it is worth mentioning that there are already similar initiatives in place for other failing crypto companies, such as Voyager, so the possible suitors for the takeover of BlockFi are reduced.

cryptocurrency with an overall valuation of nearly $6 billion, continues to keep its losses in this prevailing crypto winter to minimal levels.On November 8, despite the negative effects of the collapse of the FTX exchange platform, the digital asset managed to briefly surpass the psychological $7 marker, peaking at $7.38.DOT wasn’t able to sustain this gain and quickly abandoned the territory, hovering around the $6 region before eventually falling to the $5 range which it continues to maintain despite the ongoing bear market.According to latest tracking from Coingecko, Polkadot is trading at $5.13 at the time of this writing, being down by only 1.3% over the last seven days.Despite painting its chart in red, the digital asset has so far parried all the heavy blows of this bear cycle responsible for making the crypto market cap go down by almost 2% during the last 24 hours.As its trading price and total market capitalization continues to be at the mercy of the winter season for crypto space, Polkadot has turned its focus on aspects where it can emerge victorious and enjoy positive developments.For example, the nomination pools for the project successfully achieved a milestone when the current number of DOT bonded by members of its pool surpassed the 500,000 marker.Last week, at the time when industry leaders Bitcoin and Ethereum failed to make any kind of move to turn the tides on their favor, social mentions and engagements for Polkadot both increased.According to social analytics platform LunarCrush, during that time, the project tallied a 68.9% jump on its social mention numbers and an equally impressive 71.4% increase on its social engagements.It proved that despite all the FUD that have been ravaging the space for quite some time now, interest for Polkadot network and its DOT crypto asset remained high.Owing to the fluctuating price of DOT at the start of the current year, crypto experts have forecasted that the asset will exit the month of November with an average price of $5.70.However, as it is currently changing hands at $5.13, the altcoin might need to perform a bit of a surge during the next few hours to end November with a value that is close to the forecast.Meanwhile, the predictions for the month of December for Polkadot is almost the same as its average price next month is expected to be at $5.86, with the digital coin

On Nov. 15, Cointelegraph reported that FTX-owned Japanese cryptocurrency exchange Liquid took to Twitter to officially announce it had suspended fiat and crypto withdrawals on its Liquid Global platform."

Because of their size, the audit regulator, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), inspects them only once every three years. Of course, giant institutions like centralized crypto exchanges rarely choose transparency without being forced. Despite operating in an ecosystem that supposedly treasures openness, users aren’t yet in full revolt. Mark adds: “Why add the reporting burden if it’s not required by law and if users aren’t leaving?”Why has it taken this long for big players in the industry to spotlight transparency? “For a start, cryptocurrencies are still experiencing unprecedented rates of adoption. For us, that’s the main reason that transparency has become so talked about. The need for it is real if the space is to move forward,” says Antoni Trenchev, co-managing partner of Nexo. “When markets are growing and the global economy is booming, it’s easy to get caught up in an illusion that only great times lie ahead and be naive of trend reversals.”As the crypto space continues to grow, it’s becoming increasingly important to protect investors from fraudulent exchanges. Proof-of-reserve is certainly a step in the right direction. But there are still several improvements that could be made to enhance transparency and trust. It is crucial for investors to have access to information about an exchange’s financials. This includes information about how the business is structured and how it generates revenue. As well as details about its employees and shareholders. “Part of the reason it has taken so long for big players to adopt transparency by default is that they are just a replica of the contemporary mainstream financial system,” says Don Gossen, CEO, and co-founder of Nevermined. “The CEX’s simple argument is that their competition isn’t transparent, so why should they be.”Maybe it’s time to start expecting more.For BeInCrypto’s latest Bitcoin (BTC) analysis, click here"

Best Asset To Buy Amid Recession Fears",,CoinGape,"The global market conditions feel on the edge as the US inflation crisis hints at an upcoming recession. Nonetheless, the Fed anticipates more interest rate hikes in 2023 which makes this fear more valid. As a result, many investors think it's time to dump riskier investments and return to traditional assets like gold and silver.In this article, we will compare the performance of these investment options during previous financial crises to determine whether they should be held or not.Source-TradingviewThe global market triggered a bear market in November 2021 and tumbled several financial markets significantly. As a result, the Bitcoin price faced a similar fate and plunged 72% from its all-time high of $68,789. Furthermore, the coin price currently trades at $19277 and is trying to sustain above the demand zone of $18500.Moreover, during the coronavirus breakout, the Bitcoin price showcased a sudden bloodbath in March 2020. Thus, the coin price fell from $10500 to $3900, registering a 63% loss.Furthermore, the Bitcoin price witnessed another 83.3% downfall during the 2018 economic crisis. Source-TradingviewIf we observe the aforementioned event on the XAU/USD chart, it shows the Gold price has sustained its value despite the economic crisis. One reason for this behavior is that investors often buy these traditional assets as, historically, they have proven to retain their value. In addition, this psychology has sometimes appreciated this asset class while others were on red flags.Thus, the gold price rallied for five consecutive months while the other markets fell in November. During this period, the XAU/USDT pair showcased a 17.7% jump from $1750 to $2069. However, during the covid-19 sell-off, the gold price dropped 14.72% from $1706 high to $1450.Furthermore, the Gold price was majorly in a sideways trend during the 2018 fall. Moreover, any losses experienced during this time eventually recovered over the years.Source-TradingviewAfter analyzing the XAG/USD chart, we see that the silver price has reacted similarly to the Gold price. However, some percentage differences may act as a decision-making factor for investors.During November 2021, while the gold price rose 17.7%, the silver price rallied 25% concerning the low($21.4) and high($27) of the following five months.During the coronavirus breakout, the XAG/USDT price slumped from $17.5 to $11.7, registering a 33% loss. However, the post-correction rally accounted for 155% growth as silver price hit a high of $29.8, whereas gold showcased a 40% bull run as it reached the $2030 mark.Similar to gold, the silver price experienced a sideways rally, but during their post-correction rally, the gold price showed a 70% rally where the silver registered 40%.Note- during the post-covid rally, the Bitcoin price rallied 1600% and reached a high of $65000, whereas, after the 2018 fall, which plunged prices to $3200, the coin showed a bull run to $14000, registering a 330% jump.ConclusionThus, it depends on personal risk and reward appetite for holding any of these assets. During the recession, when the major financial market witnessed terrible losses, the Gold and Silver prices showcased minimal losses. Thus, during weak economic times, faint-hearted investors should avoid risky assets and may invest in gold or silver.Having said that, the above analysis shows the crypto and stock market offer maximum gains during the bull market."

As recent data from the world’s largest decentralized prediction market Polymarket shows market participants now estimate the probability of a Genesis insolvency at only 59% by the end of year (EOY).The peak value was 81%.
